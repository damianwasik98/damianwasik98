# Hi, I'm Damian üëãüèª 
I'm a Backend Dev who loves building cool stuff. Been doing this for 5+ years now, mostly developing and maintaining backend systems that handle the heavy lifting.

### What I'm up to
When I'm not debugging production code, you'll find me:

- Tinkering with my homelab setup
- Brainstorming new business ideas (someday I'll actually build one, not just think about it)
- Breaking (and fixing) things
- Learning new tech because... why not?
- Enjoying life outside tech - traveling, sports, and seeking adventures with friends (I'm not as geeky as you might think). You can check out the travelling project I created with my friends [danswithus](https://instagram.com/danswithus).

### Cool Things I've Built
**[DMSales](https://dmsales.com/en/)** - Marketing Automation SaaS

Comprehensive marketing automation solution for businesses. I boosted this platform with data. I did web scraping, data processing, integrations and APIs.
  
**[LVBET](https://lvbet.com/sports/en/)** - Sports betting platform

Maintained a high-available distributed backend system. This is where I first met Kubernetes (love at first sight).

**[Kubernetes Homelab](https://github.com/damianwasik98/homelab)**

Started a homelab because... well, who doesn't want their own tech playground?

I found this as the best way to learn. I'm hands-on with my learning, so it's perfect for exploring and experimenting with new technologies.

### Current interests
Mainly diving into Backend, but playing around with React and React Native on the side - just for fun.

### Communities

I believe that I can only grow faster with a right group of experienced like-minded people. I'm actively involved in:

- [KubeCraft](https://www.skool.com/kubecraft) expanding my Backend/DevOps knowledge, collaborating on best practices and exploring new technologies.
- [Akademia SaaS](https://akademiasaas.pl/) learning how to transform technical expertise into successful products by gaining experience from other SaaS founders.
